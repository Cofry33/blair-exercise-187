 * AUTHOR: Corey Blair
 * COURSE: CPT187
 * PURPOSE 		 THIS WILL ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO LOG INTO ACCOUNTS OR CREATE ACCOUNTS 
 * 				 SO THAT THEY MAY PURCHASE ITEMS FROM A CUSTOMER CHOSEN LIST OF AVAILABLE 
 * 			     ITEMS WITHIN THE CUSTOMER'S COMPUTER (honestly not sure how I'm supposed to explain inputting file names in non-programming terms) 
 * 				 AFTERWARDS THEY WILL RECEIVE A RECEIPT WITH THE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR PURCHASE. 
 * 				 UPON SAYING THAT THEY ARE DONE PURCHASING EVERYTHING, THEY WILL RECEIEVE ANOTHER RECEIPT
 * 				 WITH ALL OF THEIR PURCHASES MADE IN ONE SESSION. 
 * CREATEDATE: 	DECEMBER 3rd, 2020
